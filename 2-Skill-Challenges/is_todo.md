# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

The user wants to be able to check if a given text includes the string '#TODO' to jeep track of tasks. He will want to interact with the program by giving it an input, and receiving an output.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```ruby
- identify input and output
- input: a string of text
- output: a boolean value, true if the text includes '#TODO', false otherwise.
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
input: "Go buy groceries #TODO" -> output: true
input: "Go buy groveries" -> output: false
input: "" -> output: false
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
